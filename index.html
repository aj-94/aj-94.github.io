    <p>I liked this webpage in particular because of it's simplistic yet captivating nature. The page is not hard to navigate; typical scroll-down website with information about the company and of the dancers. I really enjoy that theme of the page incorporates pictures of the dancers with a black background.</p>

        <p> I have been on the Spotify home website, but never on the "Year in Music" page. I found this page very mesmerizing; the color scheme is really appealing to the eye. As you scroll down the page, you get different categories of music rankings, top hits, different genres, etc. What also made this page really interesting is that as you scroll down, the color scheme progressively changes color as well.</p>

        <p>I was on the awwards.com page looking for websites to look at, and this one specifically caught my attention because it had Amy Winehouse on the homepage. I decided to take a look at what it was all about and it is a webpage created by a French designer who seems to focus on talking about different projects. As you scroll up and down, the direction of the page will either go left and right depending on the direction in which you scroll. When you click on a certain project he has worked on, it takes you into another page that goes into further detail of the project chosen. For me personally, it is a really interesting set up, which I think is why I enjoyed it so much.</p>
