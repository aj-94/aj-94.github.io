   Hey there! My name is Arnoldo Heredia and I'm a Junior at Eastern Washington University majoring in Visual Communication Design. I plan on minoring in Art and Journalism, but we shall see where the tides of life lead me. Design has always been something that has fascinated me because it really is a new art form -in relation to others- that has been developing for while now. I am especially fascinated in designs that have gone from analog works to digital. I am only looking to expand my knowledge in this field and discover many other designers.
